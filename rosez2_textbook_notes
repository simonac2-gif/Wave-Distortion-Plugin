-distortion effects produce either hard clipping or soft clipping
-clipping prevents issues with the Nyquist limit and aliasing. The act of chopping off the top of the waveform can also be used to make a cool sounding effect
-soft clipping: smoother, warmer sound
-hard clipping: bright, harsh, buzzy sound
-distortion can be on a spectrum of soft to hard clipping
-input gain changes how the effect sounds by multiplying the input signal before it gets checked by the clipping threshold (greater multiplyer = more clipping distortion)
-hard clipping is more common while soft clipping you have to aritificially create using a characteristic curve
